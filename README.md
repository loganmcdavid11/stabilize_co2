# Stabilize CO2 Emissions with Renewable Energy
 ## Problem Statement and Background
### Problem
- *How much do renewables need to grow to stabilize CO2 emissions over the next 20 years?*
  - My insperation for this question is becasue I have a passion for making data-driven decisions for a business or a company.
  - I also am extremely interested in the environment, and I believe data is the single most important tool for companies to make smart decisions on how they should approach their environmental decisions.
### Background
- Dataset sources are:
